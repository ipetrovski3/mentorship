# Car

Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.

```ruby
class MyCar
# Write your solution here
end

```

If you want to test and play with your solution, type this above into a single ruby file, and from Terminal (using IRB) run:

 `irb -r ./car.rb`

_Make sure you are in the right path. Meaning running `ls` from the Terminal, should list the `car.rb` file._

_Please note if you are making changes to the `car.rb`, you must exit from IRB an re-run the command above_

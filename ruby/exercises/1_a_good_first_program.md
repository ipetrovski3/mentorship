# A good first program

```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts 'Yay! Printing.'
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
```

Type this above into a single ruby file, and from Terminal run:

 `ruby file_name.rb`

---

## **What should you see**

```shell
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
```
